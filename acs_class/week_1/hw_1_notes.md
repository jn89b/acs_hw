## 1 Conops 
**Surveillance** 105 c. Unmanned Systems conduct persistent surveillance for situational awareness. They can provide 
106 force application, including targeting, lethal fires, and non-lethal effects, while protecting the force 
107 through standoff from threat capabilities. Unmanned Systems also enable sustainment and force 
108 support operations through the automation of critical missions, including: assured mobility, 
109 transportation, distribution, maintenance, explosive ordinance disposal, communications, and health 
110 services. Integrated teams of air, ground, and maritime (surface and subsurface) manned and 
111 unmanned systems will enable all warfighter function capabilities to defeat the enemy, under any 
112 conditions in the current and future OE.

## 3 Required Capability 
158 a. Unmanned Systems provide commanders with capabilities necessary to provide dynamic 
159 situational awareness (SA), employ lethal to non-lethal scalable effects to defeat any enemy,
160 protect, and sustain the force, and assure freedom of maneuver. The required capabilities in this 
161 paragraph are organized by Warfighting Function and prioritized according to the OSD FY2009-
162 2034 Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap1.
163
164 (1) Intelligence: The JFC requires a layered network of unmanned, manned, and space sensor 
165 capabilities enabling persistent, all weather, all terrain, multi-discipline situational awareness of the OE. 
166 Unmanned Systems provide unique sensor employment capabilities enhancing the Commander’s SA and 
167 understanding.

191 (5) Movement and Maneuver: Unmanned Systems will assist in conducting tasks required for
192 assured mobility and freedom of maneuver for the Warfighter. Unmanned Systems will enhance the 
193 commander’s reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities, with range and endurance to support 
194 worldwide contingency operations. U nmanned Systems will be capable of collaboration and 
195 coordination, autonomous operations, manned / unmanned teaming, and reducing Soldier loads. 
196 Unmanned Systems will provide lethal and non-lethal force application for effective maneuver and 
197 engagement in order to produce maximum relative combat power at the decisive place and time.

## 4 Capability Gaps and Overlaps or Redundancies

### a. Missions, tasks, and functions that cannot be performed or are unacceptably limited.
242 (1) Intelligence: The current force lacks the ability to conduct persistent multi-discipline 
243 intelligence collection, near-real-time reallocation, and dynamic re-tasking of assets. The leap ahead technology to full autonomous capability with smart learning and self-adaptiveself 
245 adaptive applications will allow for intelligence fusion reduce cognitive workloads. This gap is 
246 an issue of both sufficiency (insufficient number of intelligence collection assets) and a lack of 
247 capability (limited sensing and endurance of assets).

259 (4) Command and Control: The force lacks sufficient capability to enable a robust network
260 to fully support information and knowledge connectivity with required capacity throughout the 
261 extended OE. Unmanned Systems will also provide network extension capabilities to enable a 
262 robust network to fully support information and knowledge connectivity. This lack of capability 
263 impacts collaboration and dissemination of relevant information for the Common Operational
264 Picture (COP), creating entire communications enterprise overload. The capability to access, 
265 update and collaborate on consistent geospatial and environmental data across the OE does not 
266 exist. Classification policies between nations, the absence of technological competency, 
267 consistency, and standards between disparate applications, further complicated by language and 
268 cultural differences, are examples of the challenges facing Commanders in the execution of 
269 Unified Action. Due to limited availability and capacity of the Space segment, long rang and 
270 beyond-line-of-site connectivity gaps for ground forces exist.

## Threat and Operational Environment
370 c. Threats to Unmanned Systems. Threats to Unmanned Systems will be dependent upon platform 
371 and mission, but may include sea, ground, artillery, air, air defense, or any other type of conventional or 
372 unconventional attack. The primary threats to Unmanned Systems are physical damage and/or 
373 destruction by enemy combatants using bullets (including armor piercing); anti-armor munitions (hand 
374 held HEAT) and anti-material sniper rifles; surface and subsurface munitions and mines; indirect fire 
375 (rockets, mortars and artillery) with improved conventional munitions (ICM) and precision guided 
376 munitions (PGM); enhanced blast munitions (EBM) including thermobarics, flame and fire, mines, and 
377 improvised explosive devices (IEDs); surface-to-air missiles (SAM); and air defense artillery. Other 
378 threats include, fixed and rotary wing aircraft, UAS, UGS, UMS, CBRN, and information operations. 
379 Electronic attack will potentially threaten associated communications, data link, and position navigation 
380 systems; computer network operations could threaten associated networks. Enemies will possess a 
381 wide variety of target acquisition means from the intercept of unencrypted cell phone traffic, through 
382 image intensification (active and passive infrared), and thermal imaging systems. 

**Employment of 
383 various camouflage, concealment, cover, denial, and deception means including obscurants, nets, and 
384 coatings will complicate intelligence collection missions. Finally, adversaries may employ various 
385 physical barriers and other techniques to counter employment of smaller and perhaps other Unmanned 
386 Systems. Directed energy weapons, including laser and radiofrequency weapons, and other developing 
387 technologies will pose increased threats over time**

392 2008, and the Chemical/Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Warfare Capstone Threat Assessment, DIA393 05-0909-027, October 2009.
